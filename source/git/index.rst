Introduction to git
=========================

git is a version control system, which makes it easy to follow changes of your project. Therefore, please work through sections 1 to 7 of `this tutorial <http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/>`_.

If you have questions please, post it in the `GitHub geoscripting forum <https://github.com/orgs/geoscripting/teams/advanced-geoscripting-2020/discussions>`_

If necessary, I will add some video tutorials here.
