Communication during the course will happen using different platforms.

During the course we will mainly communicate via `heiCONF <https://heiconf.uni-heidelberg.de/>`_. The link to the heiCONF room will be sent to you via email.

GitHub
*******

All course material will be available on GitHub. Please create a GitHub account and send me your user name, so I can invite you to the "geoscripting" organization.

Forum
******

If you have questions or problems please ask and discuss them on `GitHub <https://github.com/orgs/geoscripting/teams/advanced-geoscripting-2020/discussions>`_. This is a private forum, so all messages are only visible for the course participants.
