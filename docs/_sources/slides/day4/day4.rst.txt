Assignments
==========================

Notebooks for submission through GitHub Classroom
----------------------------------------------------

1. assignment-1/02-geopandas.ipynb (bike safety analysis)
2. assignment-3/13-Advanced-Raster-Data-Analysis.ipynb (water frequency)

----


Project
==========

**Purpose:** Practice applying best-practices in scientific programming

**Before** you start working on the project, choose three best practices which you would like to practice, e.g.
* Use git regularly during development
* Write tests
* Follow Python code style.

**While** doing the project, focus especially on applying these best practices.

**After** the project, reflect on how well you were able to apply them and what benefits you got from applying them.

One requirement: It needs to be reproducible!
-------------------------------------------------------

* Document how to set up the python environment
* Document how to run it:
  * Which parameters are necessary?
  * How are they specified?
  * Which files are important?
* If possible, add error handling when your python script needs user input

Project topic
===============

You can choose a topic / data set you're interested in.

**Suggestions:**

* Perform an exploratory data analysis similar to the bike safety analysis
  * Create a notebook containing the analysis
  * Create module which holds the functions used during the analysis

* Set up a processing chain similar to the water frequency analysis
  * use configuration files to separate parameters and code
  *

* Write a script which processes a spatial data set in chunks by splitting the bounding box of the study area in tiles
  * Try implementing parallelisation if you are interested
  *


Project submission
======================

* Create a new GitHub repository
  * If it is public, send me the `
  * If it is private, add me as contributor so I can see it
