The task of a Geo-Information Scientist
============================================

Build three groups:

`group 1 <.>`_
`group 2 <.>`_
`group 3 <.>`_

**Discuss in groups:**

Order the terms as it makes sense to you. Which of them belong together? What do they mean?

Summary
========

* There is usually a trade off between programming time and execution time.
* Programming time is more expensive than execution time. That's why Python is so popular.
* In 99% of the time you don't need to worry about execution time, because Python optimizes a lot internally.
* When you run Python code, a lot of it is actually happening in C.
* Be aware of the the *trap of premature optimization*.
* Start simple, optimize only when necessary.
